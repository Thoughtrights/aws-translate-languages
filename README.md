# aws-translate-languages

AWS Translate supports a subset and extended variants of the two
character ISO 639-1 e.g., "es" and "es-MX" for "Spanish" and "Spanish
(Mexico)".

The list has all the AWS Translate language codes. There are currently
75 languages which AWS Translate works with. These available language
codes are then named in 11 common languages for internationalization
use within applications. Those 11 languages are themselves noted using
language codes. They are:

- Deutsch (de) "German"
- English (en) "English"
- Español (es) "Spanish"
- Français (fr) "French"
- Bahasa Indonesia (id) "Indonedian"
- Italiano (it) "Italian"
- 日本語 (jp) "Japanese"
- 한국어 (ko) "Korean"
- Português (pr) "Portugese"
- 中文 (简体) (zh-cn) "Chinese (Simplified)"
- 中文 (繁體) (zh-tw) "Chinese (Traditional)"

The source documentation is [currently here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is-languages.html)
although you would need to toggle through each language's
documenation.
