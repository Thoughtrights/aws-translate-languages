# aws-translate-languages

AWS Translate supports a subset and extended variants of the two
character ISO 639-1 e.g., "es" and "es-MX" for "Spanish" and "Spanish
(Mexico)".

The list has all the AWS Translate language codes which are then
named in 11 different languages. These internationalizations are:

- Deutsch (de) "German"
- English (en) "English"
- Español (es) "Spanish"
- Français (fr) "French"
- Bahasa Indonesia (id) "Indonedian"
- Italiano (it) "Italian"
- 日本語 (jp) "Japanese"
- 한국어 (ko) "Korean"
- Português (pr) "Portugese"
- 中文 (简体) (zh-cn) "Chinese (Simplified)"
- 中文 (繁體) (zh-tw) "Chinese (Traditional)"

The source documentation is [currently here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is-languages.html)
although you would need to toggle through each language's
documenation.
